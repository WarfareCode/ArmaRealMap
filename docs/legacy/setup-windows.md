## Arma 3 Tools

Install Arma 3 Tools from Bohemia on Steam.
It provide essential tools to build the map for the game engine.

You need to own Arma 3 to be able to download the tools. Look for "Arma 3 Tools" in the "Tools" section of Steam's Library.

Launch the Arma 3 Tools at least once to read and accept license terms.

## pboProject

Install pboProject from Mikero and it's dependencies.
It's the only tool able to binarize and package a map without issue. Future versions of ArmaRealMap may remove this requirement.

Download them from https://mikero.bytex.digital/Downloads. You need :
- DeWss.(...).Installer.exe
- DePbo.(...).Installer.exe
- DeOgg.(...).Installer.exe
- DeRap.(...).Installer.exe
- MakePbo.(...).Installer.exe
- pboProject.(...).Installer.exe
- Rapify.(...).Installer.exe

You may support Mikero by buying a license on https://mikero.bytex.digital/

## Project Drive

You have to setup your project drive. You may find various ways to make this. I've always relied on Arma 3 Tools utilities to setup it.

Launch Arma 3 Tools, then click on "Project Drive Management". Then launch the following actions :
- Mount the work drive
- Extract Game Data
- (Optionnal) Install Buldozer (It will be useful if you plan to use Terrain Builder)

Please note : 
- ArmaRealMap will automaticly mount the work drive using Arma 3 Tools if it's not mounted.
- ArmaRealMap will automaticly extract additional mods and game data when required.

## Download ArmaRealMap binary


## You're ready !
