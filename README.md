# Arma Map Studio (AMS)

## Workflow with Terrain Builder

Traditional terrain making with Arma

![Workflow](./docs/workflow-tb.svg)

## Workflow without Terrain Builder

Importing data in Terrain Builder can be really long, the new "PreCooked" workflow directly generates [layers and WRP files](./docs/files.md).

![Workflow](./docs/workflow-precooked.svg)

[Files for terrain builder](./docs/files.md) are still generated and can be used as a fallback.

## Eden Map Editor (@ArmaMapStudio + AmsUtil)

Edit your generated map in Arma 3 Eden Editor, like a regular mission : 
1. Add objects, hide objects to remove
2. Export with @ArmaMapStudio addon
3. Launch AmsUtil on the wrp file
4. Pack/Binarize again
5. It's done !

You can also edit map generated with other tools with the same way.

## Realistic Map Generator (ArmaRealMap)
Tools to generate realistic Arma3 terrain from OpenStreeMap data in an highly automated process.
